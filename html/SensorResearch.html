      This is an Apple Developer article intended to guide developers through the steps required to configure an app to read sensor data from Apple devices. 
      As I read through this article, I noticed and appreciated the information flows very well from the beginning of the project to the end. For example, 
      the very first step mentioned is submitting your app idea to Apple for approval. The article is very well organized with category headers above each paragraph, 
      screenshot examples, code illustrations, as well as links to relevant pages and documents throughout.

      <a href="https://www.developer.com/mobile/android/how-to-build-mobile-apps-with-android-sensors/"><b>How to Build Mobile Apps with Android Sensors</b></a><br />
      This is a short article with an overview of building mobile apps with Android. The main focus of the article is providing the necessary steps (and code) to 
      identify how many sensors are available on a particular device. The Android operating system supports 13 different sensors. However, not all Android devices 
      have the necessary hardware to support all of the sensors. This article demonstrates how to get a full list of sensors, or how to check if a particular sensor 
      is available on the device. Finally, example code is provided to create an app that uses light sensors to adjust background and text color based on ambient light.

      <a href="https://www.developer.com/design/working-with-a-camera-in-android/"><b>Working with a Camera in Android</b></a><br />
      I chose this article because I think it would be a helpful reference for anyone building an Android app that used the camera. I like how this article provides 
      simple examples directed at teaching someone with very limited experience. Basic mobile camera functions are discussed along with sample code to access those 
      functions. Screenshots are provided as examples of the phone features as well.

      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologies"><b>Apple Technologies</b></a><br />
       This is an excellent resource to search for any information about Apple technologies. The site includes a full searchable list of technology names in alphabetical 
       order. The search field at the top allows you to easily jump to the particular app technology you are interested in. For example, I typed in "augmented reality" to 
       learn about the Apple ARKit technology and how it is used in apps or games.
